## 🚀 Getting Started (Development)

### 1. Prerequisites
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- Telegram account
- Bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

### 2. Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd TimeSheet

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build
```

### 3. Configuration
The bot requires a Telegram bot token. Configure it using one of these methods:

#### Option 1: User Secrets (Recommended for Development)
```bash
cd TimeSheet.Presentation.Telegram
dotnet user-secrets set "Bot:Token" "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### Option 2: Environment Variable
```bash
export Bot__Token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
dotnet run
```

#### Option 3: appsettings.json
Edit `TimeSheet.Presentation.Telegram/appsettings.Development.json`:
```json
{
  "Bot": {
    "Token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
  }
}
```

**Warning**: Never commit your bot token to source control.

### 4. Registration
1. Start the bot: `dotnet run`
2. The console will display a registration command: `/register [24-word mnemonic]`
3. Send this command to the bot to register as the first user (admin)
4. For additional users, generate new mnemonics and share them privately

## 💡 How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Start your day**: `/commute` - Tracks your commute to work
2. **Start working**: `/work` - Tracks your work time
3. **Take lunch**: `/lunch` - Tracks your lunch break
4. **Resume work**: `/work` - After lunch break
5. **Go home**: `/commute` - Tracks your commute home
6. **End day**: `/commute` again to stop commute tracking

### Command Behavior
- **Toggle behavior**: Commands act as toggles
  - Starting a new state stops the previous one
  - Repeating the same command stops it
- **Commute direction**: Automatically detects commute-to-work vs commute-to-home based on context
- **Multiple work sessions**: Supported (split by lunch, etc.)

### Time Parameters
Commands support optional time parameters:
- `-m` / `+m` — action started m minutes ago / will start m minutes from now
- `[hh:mm]` — exact start time in 24h format

Examples:
- `/work -15m` - Started working 15 minutes ago
- `/lunch +10m` - Will start lunch break in 10 minutes
- `/work 09:00` - Started working at 9:00 AM

### Editing Entries
1. `/edit` - Edit the most recent entry
2. `/edit 1` - Edit 1 entry back
3. `/edit 2` - Edit 2 entries back
4. Use inline keyboard buttons for quick adjustments

### Viewing Reports
- `/report` - Generate visual reports with charts
- `/table` - View data in formatted table format
- Reports include daily breakdowns, trends, and commute patterns
