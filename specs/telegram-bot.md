# Telegram Bot Specification

## ⚠️ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - NOT MVP

This feature is **NOT** part of the basic MVP. Implement core time tracking functionality first.

---

## Overview
Telegram Bot would provide a conversational interface for time tracking through Telegram messaging app.

## When to Implement
- After core domain, application, and persistence layers are complete and tested
- After basic CLI or API interface is working
- When remote mobile access becomes a priority

## Why Not MVP
- Adds external dependency (Telegram API)
- Requires additional complexity (session management, message formatting)
- Not essential for basic time tracking functionality
- Can be added later without changing core domain logic
