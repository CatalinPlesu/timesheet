# Notifications Specification

## ⚠️ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - NOT MVP

This feature is **NOT** part of the basic MVP. Implement core time tracking functionality first.

---

## Overview
Notifications would provide alerts and reminders about work status and goals.

## When to Implement
- After core time tracking is working
- After analytics can identify notification triggers
- When proactive user engagement becomes a priority

## Why Not MVP
- Requires external services (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Adds complexity with scheduling and delivery
- Not essential for basic time tracking
- Can be added later without changing core logic
