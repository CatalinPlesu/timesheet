# Analytics & Reporting Specification

## ⚠️ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - NOT MVP

This feature is **NOT** part of the basic MVP. Implement core time tracking functionality first.

---

## Overview
Analytics & Reporting would provide insights into work patterns and productivity metrics.

## When to Implement
- After core time tracking is working and stable
- When sufficient historical data exists
- When business insights become a priority

## Why Not MVP
- Requires working time tracking first (data to analyze)
- Adds significant complexity
- Not needed to validate core business logic
- Can be built on top of existing data later
