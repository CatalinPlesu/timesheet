# Terminal UI Specification

## ⚠️ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT - NOT MVP

This feature is **NOT** part of the basic MVP. Implement core time tracking functionality first.

---

## Overview
Terminal UI would provide a command-line interface for local time tracking.

## When to Implement
- After core domain, application, and persistence layers are complete and tested
- When user-friendly CLI becomes a priority
- After core functionality is validated

## Why Not MVP
- Adds UI complexity
- Not essential for validating core business logic
- Can be added later as a presentation layer
- Initial testing can use integration tests instead
